  "sport": {
    "paragraph1": "I’m also passionate about sports. As you can see above, I took part in a seminar organized by Orange focused on sports.",
    "paragraph2": "Team and combat sports are more than just physical activities for me; they represent a true passion that shapes my personality and my approach to life. Playing team sports, whether football or basketball, has taught me the importance of collaboration, communication, and team spirit. Every match is an opportunity to work together toward a common goal, overcome challenges, and celebrate victories, big or small. These experiences remind me that success often lies in the synergy between team members. On the other hand, combat sports like boxing or MMA have taught me discipline, resilience, and self-control. Every training session is a challenge that pushes my physical and mental limits. I appreciate the individual aspect of these disciplines, where each improvement is the result of my own effort and determination."

    "paragraph2": "Music is a true source of inspiration and emotion in my life. It transports me and allows me to express my feelings in a unique way. I enjoy a variety of genres, from soothing melodies to upbeat rhythms—each piece has the power to tell me a story. Whether listening to my favorite artists or discovering new talents, music accompanies me during moments of relaxation and reflection. I also enjoy attending concerts and festivals, where the collective energy creates an unforgettable experience. For me, music is much more than just entertainment; it is a means of connection with others and an authentic expression of my identity."
